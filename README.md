# Prepare for OCI Generative AI Professional Certification
The porpuse of this repository is to promote the usage of Oracle Generative AI by providing important information and notes needed to acquire the Professional Certification

The content is structured in four parts
1. [LLM Fundamentals](./01.fundamentals/README.md)
2. [Generative AI Service](./02.generative-ai-service/README.md)
3. [Blocks for LLM Apps](./03.blocks-for-llm-apps/README.md)
4. [OCI Generative AI Service](./04.oci-generative-ai-service/README.md)

## Prerequisites
To successfully complete the certification, we should have:
* Familiarity with machine learning and deep learning concepts
* Familiarity with Python (Intermediate)
* Familiarity with foundational OCI services (IAM, Compute, Storage)
* Completed the OCI Generative AI Professional course including skill checks and practice exam

## OCI Generative AI 2024 Professional Exam
* Number of questions: 40
* Duration: 90 minutes
* Passing score: 65% (26 questions)
* Format: Multiple Choice questions

## Key Points to Remember
* Read the question very carefully
* Identify themes and keywords in the questions
* Read all the options very carefully
* We might find two choices sounding exactly the same
* Identify and discard the "distractors"
* Start with eliminating obvious options that don't apply
* Don't get struck at one place, mark for review
* Always answer, words case scenario, make a guess
